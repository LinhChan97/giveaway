We decided the best way to tackle this outdated system was to use the e-commerce business model. We are proud to be what Forbes calls "the impact model of the future," a for profit social enterprise.</p>

And while charities rely heavily on cash donations, donations of goods serve an immediate purpose while freeing up cash for other areas of operations.
Our innovation aims not only at simplifying the process of donating goods but improving it by getting only needed, new goods to charities which eliminates the problem of donated goods being damaged, old, or otherwise unable to be used by the charity.</p>
